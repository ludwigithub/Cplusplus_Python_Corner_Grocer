# CS210_SNHU
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In this project we were asked to utilize various programming languages to develop secure, efficient code for a client. The client requested a grocery tracking program that could complete three functions:
1) Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
2) Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
3) Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.
We were given starter code to help with the interaction between C++ and Python for functionality. We were tasked with creating this program that could communicate between C++ and Python, read and write from a file, sort and pull from list, and create a simple graph to represent data.

What did you do particularly well? 
In this particular task I felt like I got an extra lesson in the fact that I didn't read very closely the first time I read the instructions. I had the tasks returning from Python when it should have been C++ and vice versa. I don't know if that would consitute doing it well but I accidentially learned how to get the outcome from both ways. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 
It seems like it worked better when I was returning the histogram from Python but that defeats the purpose of creating the written file and reading from it in C++. I am sure that will prove very useful in real world experience. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
This would fall back to keeping things straight as what needs to be returned and/or passed to what and output from where. It definately took some time to get it straight.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Most definately working between the two languages. I feel like that will help me as I move through my studies. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Since the functions are separated and can be maintained and made more robust in Python it makes the program as a whole adaptable. Also the input file can be updated easily and increased.
